## Notes

This is the first incremental genre game I have created, it took a lot of planning, trial and error and at some points made my head hurt. It is not a perfect game, far from it, but it is something I created and it is something you can play! So if you like seeing numbers go up this might be a game you want to try out.

PS. There is no beaver art in the game
