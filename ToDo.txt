To do all things I can think of:
First:
Buy max buttons logic for markets
All Dam Logic
bait shop logic
There probably shouldn't be permanent research (only when proper upgrade), so move magic upgrades to just be when you have had atleast 1 magic
And maybe achievements could be a magic upgrade
FoS visible when achievements unlocked, but achievemnts hidden until unlocked or specific research
Research 14b needs to be moved to magic upgrades
TempValues["Global"]["WcBaseStorage"] specificaly research 12 doesn't seem to get applied and idk why??

Later:
Fix/Change/Remove Gold Upgrade multip (for lower price upgrades, really broken)
Buy max buttons logic for fishing (or myb ctrl click to max buy or a toggle like in other games i think?)
Think if more magic upgrades need to be added
balancing all of the game
Start adding achievemnent and FoS triggers
Tooltips for everything
Think what will magic buff, display the effects in ascension screen
Fish swim, spawn, despawn logic
Bait logic
Add fishing spot logic, different fish in different spots
Settings screen
Music, music player
Sound effects?
Change achievements to be icons from icon packs
scroll log, story
tooltips for different things in scroll log (now I know it's doable in google doc)
All upgrade, research, magic, dam, achievement names and descriptions (maybe upgrade descriptive names, cute descriptions and for research other way around but rename description to effect:)
Use big numbers like 1.33 * 10^15
All unlock locations and triggers added,
Research history
Storage overloading
Upgrade level cap at 100
Add upgrade beavers to the beaver count as a seperate value like (+ 5)
check if maple upgrade 7 gets applied and then display it in research (cheaper research) maybe actualy remove it because its not good, just let research values be static?
Rename ascension to prestege
show in save info gold or magic only when u get some
