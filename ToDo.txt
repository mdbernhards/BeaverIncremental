To do all things I can think of:
First:
Big numbers even for scientific use m,b,t, but not for bigger numbers, have less numbers after comma
All Dam Logic
bait shop logic
TempValues["Global"]["WcBaseStorage"] specificaly research 12 doesn't seem to get applied and idk why??
For Last 3 upgrades for each wood add a lock that can be unlocked with magic, it gives global upgrade
Display the extra woodcamps and the extra beavers
Move some/most calculations from process to timers (2 sec?) so that 30% of cpu isn't eaten

Later:
Add real play time counter
Add auto saves with changable intervals
Fix/Change/Remove Gold Upgrade multip (for lower price upgrades, really broken)
Buy max buttons logic for fishing (or myb ctrl click to max buy or a toggle like in other games i think?)
Think if more magic upgrades need to be added
balancing all of the game
Start adding achievemnent and FoS triggers
Tooltips for everything
Think what will magic buff, display the effects in ascension screen
Fish swim, spawn, despawn logic
Bait logic
Add fishing spot logic, different fish in different spots
Settings screen
Music, music player
Sound effects?
Change achievements to be icons from icon packs
scroll log, story
tooltips for different things in scroll log (now I know it's doable in google doc)
All upgrade, research, magic, dam, achievement names and descriptions (maybe upgrade descriptive names, cute descriptions and for research other way around but rename description to effect:)
All unlock locations and triggers added,
Storage overloading
Upgrade level cap at 100
Add upgrade beavers to the beaver count as a seperate value like (+ 5)
Rename ascension to prestege
show in save info gold or magic only when u get some
