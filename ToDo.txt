To do all things I can think of:
First:
Check if all value multip get used, apply or remove some.
Implement keep first 10 research
Dam completion and Effect application
Tooltip on resource bar for incoming / outgoing wood brakedown
Game feature unlock system / have debug mode where everything is unlocked
Fish swim, spawn, despawn logic

Later:
implement auto research
implement keep classic, rare, mythic wood upgrades
implement magic gain without ascending
info screen with all values 5h
achievement tooltips
Tick logic not perfect when a lot of dam construction it goes in to -, sometimes wierd stuff happens
Research history broken
On magic mouse over see how mutch magic each resource gives
Move some/most calculations from process to timers (2 sec?) so that 30% of cpu isn't eaten
For Last 3 upgrades for each wood add a lock that can be unlocked with magic, it gives global upgrade
bait shop logic
Add auto saves with changable intervals
Fix/Change/Remove Gold Upgrade multip (for lower price upgrades, really broken)
Buy max buttons logic for fishing (or myb ctrl click to max buy or a toggle like in other games i think?)
balancing all of the game
Start adding achievemnent triggers
Tooltips for everything
Bait logic
Add fishing spot logic, different fish in different spots
Settings screen
Music, music player
Sound effects?
Change achievements to be icons from icon packs
scroll log, story
tooltips for different things in scroll log (now I know it's doable in google doc)
All upgrade, research, magic, dam, achievement names and descriptions (maybe upgrade descriptive names, cute descriptions and for research other way around but rename description to effect:)
Storage overloading
Upgrade level cap at 100
Rename ascension to prestege
